## Variables

- dx_sm: the small step length when moving node(s) in x axis.
- dx_lg: the large step length when moving node(s) in x axis.
- dy_sm: the small step length when moving node(s) in y axis.
- dy_lg: the large step length when moving node(s) in y axis.
- pick: the pick size of cursor. A smaller pick size makes it easer to pick a
      single node, but harder to pick the whole line.
